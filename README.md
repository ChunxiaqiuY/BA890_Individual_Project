Business Problem & Project Description
The research shows if the company deals with every customer in the same way, it will close 25 percent to 30 percent of the contacts. Understanding the personalities of customers can help the company better manage and advertise its product and service. Also, it will give the company a competitive edge in the market. In general, companies differentiate customers into four segments, including thinkers, drivers, expressive, and feelers. Each segment differs in how they process information and responds to advertising.

The motivation for this project stemmed from analyzing customers’ personal information such as age, education, income, and buying preference, which creates artificial customer segmentations. The project will determine customers’ specific needs, behaviors, and concerns to help companies modify and balance their budget by not maximizing advertising campaigns.
